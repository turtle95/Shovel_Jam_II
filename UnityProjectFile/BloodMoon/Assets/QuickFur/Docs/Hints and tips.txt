	-------------------------

-Use the "materials" array to create a second material using a standard shader for
the base layer.

-The wind and gravity fields should only be used with small values - larger values
will produce undesirable artefacts.

-Note that the wind effects are independent of Wind Zones placed in the scene, which 
have no effect onthe shader.

-Use the "Use World Space Gravity" and "Use World Space Wind" sliders to adjust the 
gravity and wind effects in world or object space.

-As a rough performance guide for these shaders, the number of shells, or "steps"
is roughly equal in performance to drawing the object that many times, so the
10-step shaders are about as expensive as drawing 10 objects, while the 40-step
shaders are about as expensive as drawing 40 objects.

-The 10-step shaders are approximately half as computationally expensive as the 
20-step ones, but artefacts become obvious at short distances, try using these
if you prioritise performance, or for long-distance objects. Similarly, the
unlit shaders are also less expensive (as they don't use per-layer lighting),
so use those if you prioritise performance. The 5-step shaders are the least
computationally expensive, but the effect is sub-par for most use-cases. Use
these if necessary.

-The 40-step shaders are very expensive. For most uses, the 20-step shaders will 
serve, but the 40-step ones are useful for objects very close to the screen, and
for objects with longer hairs.

-Most of these shaders are Transparent, and so will not receive shadows. However,
the cutout shaders are opaque, and will receive shadows. Keep in mind that their
shadows will not render correctly unless you are using the Deferred rendering path.

-When using the Unlit shaders, you can use the Brightness, Thickness and Occlusion 
sliders to blend to the base layer, giving an illusion of simple lighting.

-Creating a convincing fur map can be as simple as generating noise. Feel free to use
the pre-generated noise from the fur map in the demo project.

-Fur maps read the hair positions from the alpha channel. Promenant hairs will be very
visible on the map, while faint hairs will have low alpha. To create gaps in the fur map,
simply clear the pixels in that area.

-Longer hairs make the object look furrier, but be aware that longer hairs cause more
shell artefacts to appear.

-Fur Occlusion increases the shadows between the hairs. Use this when dealing with
thicker hairs to make the fur more visible.

-Use the Gravity and Wind vectors in small amounts. They can stretch the hairs and produce
severe shell artefacts.

-If you are covering an entire object in fur, consider using the tiling settings on the fur
map to create finer hairs.

-The fur shaders work best on objects with smooth normals. The fur extrudes in the direction
of the vertex normals, so smoother objects will have fewer discontinuities.
